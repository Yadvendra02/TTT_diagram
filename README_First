Welcome to the TTT Curve Generator Program. 
This program is based on the map program mucg83 (http://www.phase-trans.msm.cam.ac.uk/map/steel/programs/mucg83.html), originally written by Prof. H.K.D.H. Bhadeshia.
This tool allows you to generate and visualize TTT (Time-Temperature-Transformation) curves for a specified composition. 
The package includes essential files such as "plot_TTT.plt" a Gnuplot script for plotting data, and "execute_TTT.sh" a shell script to execute necessary commands. 


Follow these steps to create your TTT diagram:

1)	Modify the "INPUT.DAT" file to reflect your desired composition.
2)	Execute the script using the command "./execute_TTT.sh".
3)	Navigate to the OUTPUT folder to locate the generated output files and TTT plot.
Enjoy exploring your TTT diagrams!
